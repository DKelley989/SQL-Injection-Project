        <h1>SQL Injection</h1>

        <p>SQL injection is one of the most devastating vulnerabilities that impact a business, as it can lead to
            exposure of all the sensitive information stored in an application’s database, including handy information
            such as usernames, passwords, names, addresses, phone numbers, and credit card details. It is the
            vulnerability that results when you give an attacker the ability to influence the Structured Query
            Language(SQL) queries that an application passes to a back-end database. By being able to influence what is
            passes to the database, the attacker can leverage the syntax and capabilities of SQL itself, as well as the
            power and flexibility of supporting database functionality and operating system functionality available to
            the database.
        </p>

        <p>SQL injection is an attack in which the SQL code is inserted or appended into application/user input
            parameters that are later passed to a back-end SQL server for parsing and execution. The primary form of
            SQL injection consists of direct insertion of code into parameters that are concatenated with SQL commands
            and executed.
            A less direct attack injects malicious code into strings that are destined for storage in a table or as
            metadata. When the stored strings are subsequently concatenated into a dynamic SQL command, the malicious
            code is executed. When an attacker is able to modify an SQL statement, the statement will execute with the
            same rights as the application user; when using the SQL server to execute commands that interact with the
            operating system, the process will run with the same permissions as the component that executed the
            command, which is often highly privileged.
        </p>

        <p>SQL injection is not a vulnerability that exclusively affects Web applications; any code that accepts input
            from an untrusted source and then uses that input to form dynamic SQL statements could be vulnerable.

            SQL injection was more typically leveraged against server side databases, however with the current HTML5
            specification, an attacker could equally execute JavaScript or any other codes in order to interact with a
            client side database to steal data. Similarly with mobile applications, malicious applications and/or
            client-side script can be leveraged in similar ways.

            There are many ways to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities to achieve a myriad of goals; the success of
            the attack is usually highly dependent on the underlying database and interconnected systems that are under
            attack.

            It is difficult to correctly and accurately gather data on exactly how many organizations are vulnerable to
            or have been compromised via an SQL injection vulnerability, as companies in many countries, unlike their
            US counterparts, are not obliged by law to publicly disclose when they have experienced a serious breach of
            security. The smallest of breaches, that historically may have gone unnoticed by the wider public, are
            often heavily publicized today.

        <p>Historically, attackers would compromise a Web site or Web application to score points with other hacker
            groups, to spread their particular political viewpoints and messages, to show off their “mad skillz”, or
            simply to retaliate against a perceived slur or injustice. Today, however, an attacker is much more likely
            to exploit a Web application to gain financially and make a profit.

            A wide range of potential groups of attackers are on the Internet today, all with differing motivations.
            They range from individuals looking simply to compromise systems driven by a passion for technology and a
            “hacker” mentality, focused criminal organizations seeking potential targets for financial proliferation,
            and political activists motivated by personal or group beliefs, to disgruntled employees and system
            administrators abusing their privileges and opportunities for a variety of goals. A SQL injection
            vulnerability in a Web site or Web application is often all an attacker needs to accomplish his goal.

        <p>SQL is the standard language for accessing Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, Sybase, Informix, and other
            database servers. Most Web applications need to interact with a database, and most Web application
            programming
            languages such as ASP, C#, .NET, Java, and PHP, provide programmatic ways of connecting to a database and
            interacting with it.

            SQL injection vulnerabilities most commonly occur when the Web application developer does not ensure that
            values received from a Web form, cookie, input parameter, and so forth are validated before passing them to
            SQL
            queries that will be executed on a database server. If an attacker can control the input that is sent to an
            SQL
            query and manipulate that input so that the data is interpreted as a code instead of as data, the attacker
            may
            be able to execute the code on the back-end database.</p>
